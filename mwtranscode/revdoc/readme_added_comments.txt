* 003 akuśala
<L>305.2<pc>1308,1<k1>akuṣṭhipṛṣat<k2>a-kuṣṭhipṛṣat<e>1
;; Why is this record having a "305" in L-number? it is no way related to the <L>305; this is an example of the ad-hoc <L> numbering I mentioned earlier at a different place.
; jim:  We try to (a) maintain L-numbers over time; and also (b) maintain
; increasing values of L-numbers within mw.txt.
; For various reasons such as inserting 'sup' records, we must manufacture
; a new L-number while maintaining (b).
* 005 akṣetrajña
;; The print book has a spl. purpose of having "[...]" inside a "(...)"
;; The data has "([..." at many other places (almost over 1100) wrongly, may be unknowingly put. All those need to be corrected.

* 007 agnāviṣṇū
;; At many places in the data, the number indicator du. or sg. is placed inside the gender (<lex>) marking.
;; Though they are related, they should not be kept thus, but should be separately put. Gender (<s> liṅga</s>) comes first, followed by the number (<s>vacana</s>) next.
* 010 aṅgulisaṃdeśa
;; The comp. HW entry here "aṅguli (in comp.)" has no accent mark. Should all these comp. entrywords be changed accordingly?
;; Incidentally, some HWs are marked with an accent and some are without the accent in this group!!
NO ACCENT and ANNEXURE

NO ACCENT and not in ANNEXURE
<L>1721<pc>8,2<k1>aṅgulīmukha<k2>aṅgulī-mukha<e>3

jim: conclusion is no further changes required
* 019 anāgāmin
;; The actual O(27,3) entry (under the main HW anāgāmin) mentions this HW as an-āgamī [with the ending ī given separately, in braces]. And the reference MWB. 133 has it thus- He is therefore called An-āgāmī, ‘one who will not come back to earth.’
;; This is another example of the word-endings case, I was vocal about.
;; Probably this correction can take place here, when all those word-endings are added to the data.
* 042 aśvaripu
;; But L. is mentioned in the book, only if no other literary citations are known, as a practice.
;; Does it mean Bhpr. is to be replaced by L., to be in line with the book's "idea"?
* 045 asaunāman

<s>āsandī—sád</s> ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> sitting on a chair, <ls>ŚBr. xii, 8, 3, 4.</ls><info lex="m:f:n"/>
<LEND>

<Ls>27990<pc>160,2<k1>āsandīsad<k2>āsandī́—sád<e>3
<s>āsandī́—sád</s> ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> sitting on a chair, <ls>ŚBr. xii, 8, 3, 4.</ls><info lex="m:f:n"/>
* 075 iḍādadha
;; The character | (the slp1 transliteration for ł) has some issue in the display and searching criteria, as identified elsewhere (MWS issue #88 ) and is yet to be resolved.
* 077 indraśatru
;; Also the braced portion in the original text in all the comp. words (28945-29157: a whopping lot of 200+ entries!!) under this indra HW needs attention- some are explicitly marked with accent mark and some are not marked, indicating that the front part of those "not explicitly marked" comp. words might need to have the accent mark removed.
;; As mentioned by MW himself in the Introd. pages, this accent marking has a very significant role in the Pāṇinian system (rather in any "pure Sanskrit system"); and we have to be careful in handling those markings in a diligent manner.
;; Again, leaving it to Jim to take a call on this.
* 078 indriyasaṃyama
;; This probably indicates that all the entries given thereunder (all the annexure "sup" words -6 in count- are thus rendered, except this "rev" entry!!) need to be without the accent mark in the front portion.
;; Leaving it to Jim to take a call on this.
;jim:  Checked; all these annexure compounds appear as 
; 'indriya' (without accent indriyá)
; Thus, I think no additional action required
* 096 ulmukamathya
;; This clearly indicates that the main HW and the comp. words could have the accent differences. The main HW in this case remains with the accent on the first letter.

;; The plural indicating long mātrā being in braces (ās) is as usual ignored here; could be added when the word-endings insersion time comes.
;; Also the <ab>pl.<ab> is to be taken out from the <lex> field; needs to happen sometime later.
* 113 kṣaya
;; jim: on p. 1325,3  Note: '1. kṣáya (RV.)'
;; The accent in the HW is correctly added to L-59377, but all its continuation/splits below are untouched!
;; All these above entries (59378-59387) being the continuation/splits of the 59377, need to have the accent mark added.
;; jim: i.e. 'kṣaya' -> 'kṣayá'
* 121 ci
;; The <e>1 indicates this entry having been considered as large Sanskṛit type; Jim may pl. confirm this.
; jim:  NO.  <e>1 indicates text spells headwords with Devanagari, large or small
; The 'large Sanskrit type' is indicated by markup '<info verb="genuineroot".../>'  (by contrast, <info verb="root".../>)
So, we need to make the change to "genuineroot" for L=73297, 73362 (DONE)
* 171 bambaviśvavayas
  error in PW
;; R(1331,1) bamba-viśvayás (MaitrS.) [should've been bamba-viśvavayás (MaitrS.)]
;; PW has this as- bambaviśvava³yas (Maitr. S. 4, 7, 3 ) und bambā³viśva³vayas (gaṇa vanaspatyādi in der Kāś. ) m. Du. N. pr. zweier Personen. Vgl. bambhārviśvavayas.
;; The Cologne text has a typo in the first word of the entry [ID=75855] as- bambaviśraváyas (Maitr.S.4,7,3 ) und bambā́viśvávayas (gaṇa vanaspatyādi in der Kāś. ) m. Du. N.pr. zweier Personen. Vgl. bambhārviśvavayas.
;; From the PW ref. (and the gaṇapāṭha entry- bambāviśvavayasau, under the said gaṇa), it appears the intended revision HW & accent are to be doubted.
;; But the print copy of MaitrS. (श्रीपाद सांतवलेकर ed. 1942) shows the accent at ya, as marked in MW revision. (So, this time PW has an error in its data, or it might have used some other source for its compilation.)
;; Thus we can take that the revision is correctly done in the text.
;; However, this entry calls for an AND group of two entries- bamba-viśvavayás & bambā́-viśvávayas, looking at the text matter.
;; Jim is requested to do the needful.
* 179 lakṣmaṇasena
;; But the marking of A.D as <ls>A.</ls>D. needs to be corrected as <ab>A.D.</ab> as discussed elsewhere. To be done globally sometime later.
