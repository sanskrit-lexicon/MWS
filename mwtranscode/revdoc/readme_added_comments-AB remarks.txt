* 005 akṣetrajña
;; The print book has a spl. purpose of having "[...]" inside a "(...)"
;; The data has "([..." at many other places (almost over 1100) wrongly, may be unknowingly put. All those need to be corrected.
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all those places.

* 007 agnāviṣṇū
;; At many places in the data, the number indicator du. or sg. is placed inside the gender (<lex>) marking.
;; Though they are related, they should not be kept thus, but should be separately put. Gender (<s> liṅga</s>) comes first, followed by the number (<s>vacana</s>) next.
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all those places.

* 010 aṅgulisaṃdeśa
;; The comp. HW entry here "aṅguli (in comp.)" has no accent mark. Should all these comp. entrywords be changed accordingly?
;; Incidentally, some HWs are marked with an accent and some are without the accent in this group!!
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all comp. words throughout, looking at the specific accent markings whereever given.

* 019 anāgāmin
;; The actual O(27,3) entry (under the main HW anāgāmin) mentions this HW as an-āgamī [with the ending ī given separately, in braces]. And the reference MWB. 133 has it thus- He is therefore called An-āgāmī, ‘one who will not come back to earth.’
;; This is another example of the word-endings case, I was vocal about.
;; Probably this correction can take place here, when all those word-endings are added to the data.
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all those places.
* 042 aśvaripu
;; But L. is mentioned in the book, only if no other literary citations are known, as a practice.
;; Does it mean Bhpr. is to be replaced by L., to be in line with the book's "idea"?
AB: We might re-think on such matters sometime later.

* 069 āśīviṣa
;; Another session for id. & idem. entries can handle these sometime later. (as being discussed under MWS issue #98)
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all those places.
* 072 āsandīvat
;; Probably this entry also needs the accent mark change, being in ŚBr. In such a case it would be as under-
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all comp. words throughout, looking at the specific accent markings whereever given.

* 075 iḍādadha
;; The character | (the slp1 transliteration for ł) has some issue in the display and searching criteria, as identified elsewhere (MWS issue #88 ) and is yet to be resolved.
AB: Need to wait for the display & search issues like this (MWS issue #88) to be attended to.

* 077 indraśatru
;; Also the braced portion in the original text in all the comp. words (28945-29157: a whopping lot of 200+ entries!!) under this indra HW needs attention- some are explicitly marked with accent mark and some are not marked, indicating that the front part of those "not explicitly marked" comp. words might need to have the accent mark removed.
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all comp. words throughout, looking at the specific accent markings whereever given.

* 078 indriyasaṃyama
;; This probably indicates that all the entries given thereunder (all the annexure "sup" words -6 in count- are thus rendered, except this "rev" entry!!) need to be without the accent mark in the front portion.
;; Leaving it to Jim to take a call on this.
;jim:  Checked; all these annexure compounds appear as 
; 'indriya' (without accent indriyá)
; Thus, I think no additional action required
AB: It is meant about other entries in the main pages. (I already mentioned that the annexure entries are without the accents!)
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all comp. words throughout, looking at the specific accent markings whereever given.

* 096 ulmukamathya
;; This clearly indicates that the main HW and the comp. words could have the accent differences. The main HW in this case remains with the accent on the first letter.
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all comp. words throughout, looking at the specific accent markings whereever given.

* 099 ṛṇacit
; jim:  Also added '<info n="rev" pc="1322,3"/>'
AB: L-38870 is revised with a "rev" marking, but L-388770.1 is not deleted.

* 104 kaca
;; jim  Syntax for 'local abbreviation' <ab n="note">n.</ab>
AB: Why only some are locally expanded and some are not?

* 109 kumāradeṣṇa
;; jim revise  right square bracket added	<s>kumāra—deṣṇa</s> ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> granting perishable gifts [‘whose gifts are like those of children,’ <ab>i.e.</ab> ‘who gives and takes back’ <ls>Sāy.</ls>]; <ls>RV. x, 34, 7.</ls> <info n="rev" pc="1325,1"/><info lex="m:f:n"/>
AB: A mistake in my suggestion, the square bracket should be followed by a comma, not with a semi-colon, before the first <ls>.
AB: The <ls>Sāy.</ls>, being part of the explanatory matter in sqaure bracket, doesn't count to be the first <ls> here. 

* 110 kurukṣetra
;; The plural indicating long mātrā being in braces (ās) is as usual ignored here; could be added when the word-endings insersion time comes.
;; Also the <ab>pl.<ab> is to be taken out from the <lex> field; needs to happen sometime later.
AB: Need to keep in mind to consider these cases throughout later.

* 113 kṣaya
;; jim: on p. 1325,3  Note: '1. kṣáya (RV.)'
AB: I missed the text R(1325,3) 1. kṣáya (RV.); which properly applies to L-59267. This accent change has to be done to that single entry.

* 171 bambaviśvavayas
;; However, this entry calls for an AND group of two entries- bamba-viśvavayás & bambā́-viśvávayas, looking at the text matter.
AB: HWs splitting and "AND" grouping differed for timebeing?

* 179 lakṣmaṇasena
;; But the marking of A.D as <ls>A.</ls>D. needs to be corrected as <ab>A.D.</ab> as discussed elsewhere. To be done globally sometime later.
AB: Need to keep in mind as a TODO point.

* 193 sanisrasa 
;; <L>231174.1 "This stands deleted, as a NULL record; to be deleted completely at the end."
;jim: Odd -- why is this entry in the supplement?
AB: This is a cross-referenced entry, under the sa- group. This HAS TO BE added as indicated and marked with <hom>a/b markings.

* ---------------------------------------------------
* additional simple changes
* ---------------------------------------------------
* DONE 113 kṣaya
AB: I missed the text R(1325,3) 1. kṣáya (RV.); but that properly applies to L-59267. This accent change has to be done to that single entry.

* DONE 140 dhṛṣṭa
AB: The L-101953.5 deletion is missed, though the matter is applied at  L-101946 as suggested.

* ---------------------------------------------------
* other complex revisions
* ---------------------------------------------------
* DONE 075 iḍādadha
AB: Need to look when then display & search issues for this would be attended to.

* DONE 153 pātraAB: This is the first header for looking at accent marking corrections, to be applied to ALL the comp. HWs under it.

* THE END
