These are suggested change ideas related to MW digitization at Cologne.
Most are from @Andhrabharati; a few are from @funderburkjim.

## square bracket inside paren
Noticed with akṣetrajña.
The print book has a spl. purpose of having "[...]" inside a "(...)"
The data has "([..." at many other places (almost over 1100) wrongly, may be unknowingly put. All those need to be corrected.

## placement of sg./du./pl. in lex tag
Noticed with agnāviṣṇū
At many places in the data, the number indicator du. or sg. is placed inside the gender (`<lex>`) marking.
Though they are related, they should not be kept thus, but should be separately put. Gender (`<s> liṅga</s>`) comes first, followed by the number (`<s>vacana</s>`) next.

upāsakadaśā 
The `<ab>` string for the 'number' (`<s> vacana</s>` needs to be out of the gender `<f>` string as mentioned elsewhere. All such corrections in the whole text can take take place sometime later.

kurukṣetra 
The plural indicating long mātrā being in braces (ās) is as usual ignored here; could be added when the word-endings insersion time comes.
Also the `<ab>pl.<ab>` is to be taken out from the `<lex>` field; needs to happen sometime later.


## accents on compound words
Noticed with ulmukamathya
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all comp. words throughout, looking at the specific accent markings whereever given.
This clearly indicates that the main HW and the comp. words could have the accent differences. The main HW in this case remains with the accent on the first letter.

## omission of word-ending (ī,as,us, etc.)
Noticed with anāgāmin
The actual O(27,3) entry (under the main HW anāgāmin) mentions this HW as an-āgamī [with the ending ī given separately, in braces]. And the reference MWB. 133 has it thus- He is therefore called An-āgāmī, ‘one who will not come back to earth.’
This is another example of the word-endings case, I was vocal about.

## literary source replacements
Noticed with aśvaripu 
But L. is mentioned in the book, only if no other literary citations are known, as a practice.
Does it mean Bhpr. is to be replaced by L., to be in line with the book's "idea"?
AB: We might re-think on such matters sometime later.

## Accent differences between text and supplement

Jim: In rev, we see 'Asura (in comp.);'  (key point, no accent on initial 'A')
  Does this imply that FOR ALL COMPOUNDS of 'asura', the accent should be
  dropped?

In rev, we see (1318,2): Asṛj with no accent and:
  Asṛj (for ‘a kind of religious abstraction,’
   read, ‘N. of the 16th of the astrological Yogas, also called Siddhi’)

 In the main text, with see an accent: ásṛj  with various senses.
 AB infers that there should be NO accent in all the other various senses.
 Jim: Another inference would be that the accent is lost ONLY for the
  altered sense 'N. of 16th ...' mentioned in the Supplement.

## id. abbreviation
Noticed with āśīviṣa
Another session for id. & idem. entries can handle these sometime later. (as being discussed under MWS issue #98)

## Accent recoding in compounds
Noticed with āsandīvat
Probably this entry also needs the accent mark change, being in ŚBr.
In such a case it would be as under-
```
<Ls>27990<pc>160,2<k1>āsandīsad<k2>āsandī́—sád<e>3
<s>āsandī́—sád</s> ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> sitting on a chair, <ls>ŚBr. xii, 8, 3, 4.</ls><info lex="m:f:n"/>	<LEND>
```
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all comp. words throughout, looking at the specific accent markings whereever given.

Noticed with aṅgulisaṃdeśa
The comp. HW entry here "aṅguli (in comp.)" has no accent mark. Should all these comp. entrywords be changed accordingly?
Incidentally, some HWs are marked with an accent and some are without the accent in this group!!
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all comp. words throughout, looking at the specific accent markings whereever given.

Noticed with indraśatru, pc=167,1 (1321,1)
Also the braced portion in the original text in all the comp. words (28945-29157: a whopping lot of 200+ entries!!) under this indra HW needs attention- some are explicitly marked with accent mark and some are not marked, indicating that the front part of those "not explicitly marked" comp. words might need to have the accent mark removed.
AB: Need to keep in mind as TODO yet in all comp. words throughout, looking at the specific accent markings whereever given.

## The slp1 transliteration | for  ł
Noticed with iḍādadha 
The character | (the slp1 transliteration for ł) has some issue in the display and searching criteria, as identified elsewhere (MWS issue #88 ) and is yet to be resolved.
AB: Need to look when the display & search issues for this would be attended to.

## ṛjūyat
re `<Ls>38839<pc>225,3<k1>ṛjūyat`
AB: after doing the full revision entries, I am left with a feeling that MW (and his associates) had some genuine references, to go against the PW (or PWG) which also sometimes erred (thus giving wrong refenreces).

## ci
Notice with L=73297, k1=ci, pc=394,2

As I could understand looking at the revision text, the aor. matter
`<ab>Ved.</ab> <s>cikayām akar</s>, <ls>iii, 1, 42</ls>; <ls>Kāś.</ls>`
here is to be moved to the 2. ci entry below (but with a change, akar as akaḥ- the ending r being a grammatical variant of visarga ḥ.)
Seen that PWG is having this "cikayām akaḥ" under "1. ci" itself, but nothing similar under "2. ci"; and could not check if it is an error there, nor could locate the same in PW.
Probably consulting a dhātupāṭha work might help clearing the point.
Finally, this is not marked as a "rev".
AB: As the correction is not done, naturally the "rev" tagging is not put.
AB: I would like to lookup this entry closely sometime again; strongly feel this to take place (like at "bambaviśvavayas").
AB: Also my ending remark at "ṛjūya" above may be looked at.
AB: after doing the full revision entries, I am left with a feeling that MW (and his associates) had some genuine references, to go against the PW (or PWG) which also sometimes erred (thus giving wrong refenreces).

## dādada
L=91239, k1=dādada, pc=474,1
But why is Śiś. required here, when the ib. is present? Probably that could also be 'erased'.
AB: Probably we can have a second thought about having the Śiś. here.
jim: Probably 'ib.' here means in the same verse of Śiś. as previously
   mentioned, namely `<ls>Śiś. xix, 114.</ls>` in L=91238, dāda

## niṣṭakvan
L=110899, k1=niṣṭakvan, pc=563,1
We might have to trace out the base for the revised meanings ‘roaming, vagrant’, instead of the orig. meaning- prob. ‘running away’ -which tallies with both PWG and PW.
AB: So, PWG and PW are not always the final sources for MW (see my latest comments under 38839 & 73297).

## missed 'or'/'and' entries
Noticed with aṅgārakayantra, L=1672.1, pc=1309,2
alternate HW entry "bhauma-yantra" missed here.
A(1309,2) aṅgāraka-yantra (or bhauma-y°), ... ... ...

```
<L>.1<pc>1309,2<k1>aṅgārakayantra<k2>aṅgāraka-yantra<e>3
<s>aṅgāraka-yantra</s>¦ (or <s>bhauma</s>-<s>y</s>°), <lex>n.</lex> a kind of auspicious diagram, <ls>Inscr.</ls><info n="sup"/><info lex="n"/>
```
There are 296 such entries "¦ (or \<s>", which need to be split as sep. entries and marked as OR group.
There are 596 entries "¦ or \<s>", which need to be split as sep. entries and marked as OR group.
There are 18 entries "¦ (and \<s>", which need to be split as sep. entries and marked as AND group.
There are 140 entries "¦ and \<s>", which need to be split as sep. entries and marked as AND group.
probably few more in some other notation may also be there, that are to be split and xxx group marked.

## form of 'or' and 'and' groups
jim: How to enter 'or' and 'and' groups?
  The new metaline `<L>...` is not the question.
  Rather, the question is how to represent the 'gloss'.
  I propose that the gloss of both be IDENTICAL and closely related to
  the printed text.
  Note that this proposal has NOT normally been followed.
  Example:
```
<L>142892<pc>721,3<k1>bambaviśvavayas<k2>bamba-viśvavayás<e>1
<s>bamba-viśvavayás</s> ¦ (<ls>MaitrS.</ls>) and <s>bambā́-viśvávayas</s> (<ls>TS.</ls>; <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>g.</ab> <s>vanaspaty-ādi</s>, <ls>Kāś.</ls>) <lex>m. <ab>du.</ab></lex> <ab>N.</ab> of 2 men (also <s>bambhār-viśvavayas</s>, <ls>Kāṭh.</ls>) <info and="142892,bambaviSvavayas;142892.1,bambAviSvavayas"/><info n="rev" pc="1331,1"/><info lex="m"/>
<LEND>
and the alternate
<L>142892.1<pc>721,3<k1>bambāviśvavayas<k2>bambā́-viśvávayas<e>1
<s>bamba-viśvavayás</s> ¦ (<ls>MaitrS.</ls>) and <s>bambā́-viśvávayas</s> (<ls>TS.</ls>; <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>g.</ab> <s>vanaspaty-ādi</s>, <ls>Kāś.</ls>) <lex>m. <ab>du.</ab></lex> <ab>N.</ab> of 2 men (also <s>bambhār-viśvavayas</s>, <ls>Kāṭh.</ls>) <info and="142892,bambaviSvavayas;142892.1,bambAviSvavayas"/><info n="rev" pc="1331,1"/><info lex="m"/>
<LEND>
```
## A.D. abbreviation error
noticed at L=180503, k1=lakṣmaṇasena, pc=892,2
```
But the marking of A.D as <ls>A.</ls>D. needs to be corrected as
<ab>A.D.</ab> as discussed elsewhere.
To be done globally sometime later.
```
